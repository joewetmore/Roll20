@{wtype}&{template:traits} @{charname_output} {{name=Wand of Fireballs}} {{source=Object: Wand}} {{description=This wand has 7 Charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its Charges to cast the Fireball spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The wand regains 1d6+1 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.}}

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.}}
